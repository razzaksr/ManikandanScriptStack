Here are the steps to turn on or turn off JavaScript in Firefox -

    Open a new tab -> type about: config in the address bar.

    Then you will find the warning dialog. Select I’ll be careful, I promise!

    Then you will find the list of configure options in the browser.

    In the search bar, type javascript.enabled.

    There you will find the option to enable or disable javascript by right-clicking on the value of that option -> select toggle.

If javascript.enabled is true; it converts to false upon clicking toogle. If javascript is disabled; it gets enabled upon clicking toggle.
